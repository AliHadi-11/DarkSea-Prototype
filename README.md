## 🎯 About the Project

**Dark Sea** is a 3D first-person survival horror game set in a deep underwater environment. Unlike traditional horror games that rely on visual scares, Dark Sea uses **3D spatial audio**, **sonar-based navigation**, and **AI-driven enemies** to create an immersive experience that is equally accessible to both sighted and visually impaired players.

The game was developed as a **Final Year Project** at the **University of Lahore** (BSCS 2022–2026).

> *"We believe accessibility in gaming is not a feature — it's a right."*

## ❗ Problem Statement

Most horror games depend on dark visuals and jump scares, creating a barrier for the **285 million visually impaired people** worldwide (WHO data). There is a significant lack of desktop-grade survival horror games that are accessible without sight.

**Dark Sea bridges this gap** by replacing visual feedback with:
- 🔊 3D Spatial Audio (directional sound)
- 📡 Sonar Echolocation System
- 🎮 Haptic Feedback (vibration alerts)
- 🤖 Voice-Mimicking AI Enemies

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 📡 **Sonar Navigation** | Press SPACEBAR to emit sound waves — detect walls and enemies by echo |
| 🧠 **Mimic AI** | Level 3 enemies copy human voices to lure and confuse players |
| 🫧 **Oxygen System** | Real-time oxygen depletion — find tanks or suffocate |
| 🗺️ **Minimap HUD** | Circular radar showing player position and enemy blips |
| 👁️ **Accessible Design** | Fully playable without sight using audio cues only |
| 🎚️ **Difficulty System** | Easy / Normal / Hard — adjusts oxygen drain and enemy speed |
| 🏆 **Score System** | Points based on oxygen remaining, time, and tanks collected |

## 🎮 Gameplay

The player is a deep-sea diver stranded in a pitch-black underwater maze. Without visual aids, survival depends entirely on **sound and spatial awareness**.

```
Start → Register/Login → Main Menu → Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 → Victory
```

### How it Works
1. **Press SPACEBAR** → Sonar ping emits sound waves
2. **Listen to echo** → Detect walls and enemy distance
3. **Check radar** → Minimap shows enemy positions as red blips
4. **Manage oxygen** → Collect glowing tanks to stay alive
5. **Reach the exit** → Beat each level to unlock the next
